# FragrAI 🌸🤖  
*A machine learning-powered fragrance recommendation engine.*

FragrAI is a fragrance recommendation system that helps users discover perfumes and colognes that match their scent preferences. Using data from Fragrantica and advanced ML models, it suggests similar fragrances based on note profiles, seasonal compatibility, and personal preferences.

## 🔍 Features
- ✅ Scrapes fragrance data (notes, accord types, reviews) from Fragrantica
- 🧠 Categorizes notes into subgroups (e.g., fruity, floral, woody, spicy)
- 🌤️ Classifies fragrances by **season** (spring, summer, fall, winter)
- 🔁 Suggests similar scents using cosine similarity + embedding-based models
- 💡 Plans for user input integration to refine recs (e.g., “I like vanilla & jasmine”)

## 🧪 Current Stack
- Python 🐍
- Pandas + NumPy
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (for modeling)
- Google Colab (experiments + visualization)
- GitHub (code storage & version control)

## 🚧 In Progress
- [ ] Clean and unify scraped fragrance note data
- [ ] Build note embeddings and similarity engine
- [ ] Add seasonal classification model
- [ ] Build a lightweight UI (Streamlit or Flask)
- [ ] Deploy to web for live demos
